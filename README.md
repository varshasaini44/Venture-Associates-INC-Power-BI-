Data Understanding 

Each Product has a Product Head who handles the performance of that Product.
• Each product has 5 KPIs on which the performance of that product is analyzed. The 5
KPIs are: CPT, LVT, NKT, MGT and IDT.
• Each KPI has a High Threshold (HT) Value and Low Threshold (LT) Value. If the Actual
Value of KPI is less than equal to LT, it is considered as Poor. If the Actual Value is
between HT and LT, it is considered as Average and if the actual value is more than
equal to HT, it is considered as Good.

Red, Average→ Amber, Good→ Green.

of KPIs and their HT, LT values.
